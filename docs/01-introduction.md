# Echoes
## Slogan
*Where every voice echoes*

## Core concept
'Echoes' is a public platform for users to share opinions, thoughts and idea with likeminded people 
through interactions maintaing their custom identity.

## Purpose
The purpose of Echoes is to provide an expressive social platform where users can publicly share their thoughts, ideas, and opinions in the form of short posts. The platform aims to promote open communication and engagement by allowing users to follow others, interact through comments, and discover content through personalized feeds. It is designed to balance simplicity and interactivity while prioritizing user experience, accessibility, and scalability.

Previously I was developing a web application with similar idea but when I tried completeing it after board examination break it was overwhelming because of lack of proper prior planning before working on the development. Therefore I am developing this project this time with aim of proper planning and proper scalability as mentioned above to maintain consistency.

## Scope 
The project will include the design and development of a web-based social media application that allows users to:
- Create and manage user accounts
- Share text-based and image posts publicly
- Follow and unfollow other users
- View posts in a feed based on whom they follow
- Edit their own profile information
- Interact with posts through comments, like and save
- Receive basic feedback (e.g., post success/failure notifications)
- Use the platform on both desktop and mobile web browsers

In-Scope Functionalities:
- User registration, login, logout
- JWT-based authentication
- Profile creation and customization
