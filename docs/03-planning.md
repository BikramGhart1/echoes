# Planning
I've Planned to split the whole system into severals module according to their purposes 
and work on them accordingly.
*Which were mentioned in requirements document too but its little bit different here*

1. Authentication Module
2. Profile Module
3. Post Module
4. Feed Module
5. Follow System

## Scheduling the work
*This is only an estimation of time required, actual schedule may be up and down*

1. Week 1 - Analysis and Design
   - Design UML diagrams (usecase, DFD, Activity and Sequence)
   - Design Layout and UI
   - Database Design

2. Week 2 - Implementation of Authentication and Profile modules
3. Week 3 - Implementation of Posts and feed module (like, comments and save features too) 
4. Week 4 - Implementation of Follow System and other leftovers
5. Week 5 - System testing, Polishing and Deployment

> Unit testing will be done after every module development (or lets say after every phase).
